# Password_Generator
Hello dear friends!
This is a classic password generator project.
Generating powerful random passwords for any use.  
This project is done with Python programming language.
I used libraries: random and re.
Its porpuse is to design strong random passwords,
using the right characters, PLUS checking,
if the final password corresponds to its requirements.
Type on your terminal : pip install re, pip install random
